--Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

--1. Total number of records for each of the tables:

SELECT COUNT(*) from business; -- Business Table (10000) rows
SELECT COUNT(*) from attribute; -- Attribute (10000)
SELECT COUNT(*) from category; -- Category (10000) rows 
SELECT COUNT(*) from checkin; -- Checkin (10000) rows
SELECT COUNT(*) from elite_years; -- elite_years (10000) rows
SELECT COUNT(*) from friend; -- friend (10000) rows 
SELECT COUNT(*) from hours; -- hours (10000) rows
SELECT COUNT(*) from photo; -- photo (10000) rows
SELECT COUNT(*) from review; -- review (10000) rows
SELECT COUNT(*) from tip; -- tip (10000) rows
SELECT COUNT(*) from user; -- user (10000) rows

--2. Total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 

SELECT Count(DISTINCT(id)) from business; -- Business Table (10000) rows
SELECT Count(DISTINCT(business_id)) from hours; -- Hours Table (1562) rows
SELECT Count(DISTINCT(business_id)) from category; -- Category Table (2643) rows
SELECT Count(DISTINCT(business_id)) from attribute; -- Attribute Table (1115) rows
SELECT  Count(DISTINCT(id)),
        Count(DISTINCT(business_id)),
        Count(DISTINCT(user_id)) 
        from review; -- review Table (10000), (8090), (9581)
SELECT Count(DISTINCT(business_id)) from checkin; -- Chekin Table (493) rows
SELECT  Count(DISTINCT(id)), 
        Count(DISTINCT(business_id)) 
        from photo; -- Photo Table (10000), (6493) Distinctive rows
SELECT  Count(DISTINCT(user_id)), 
        Count(DISTINCT(business_id))
        from tip; -- Tip Table (537) Distictive user,  (3979) Distinctive business
SELECT COUNT(id) from user; -- (10000) Distinctive users.
SELECT Count(DISTINCT(user_id)) from friend; -- Only (11) distictive users has friends
SELECT Count(DISTINCT(user_id)) from elite_years; -- (2780) Users have elite years.

-- 3. Checking NULL values on User Table

-- 4. Checking the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following tables and fields:

       MAX(review_count),
       AVG(review_count) from user;
--		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995

-- 8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

    -- As table below illustrates, posing more reviews does not necessarily correlate with more fans. 
    -- For example, although, Gerald has posed the most reviews, he has fewer fans in comparison with Mimi. 
    -- Therefore, sorting the users in descending order based on their total number of reviews does not sort the fans in the same order, 
    -- meaning that there is not a correlation between the total number of reviews and number of fans.

Businesses with 2-3 stars appear to have more hours open than the 
ones with 4-5:
        1. The rating of 2-3 stars have a median of 100 hours worked per week 
        2. While the businesses with 4-5 stars have a median of 56 hours worked per week
However we cannot conclude this for sure because there is a too small business population 
at Las Vegas, and there is much more business with 4-5 stars than the ones with 2-3 stars, 
so we need to look deeper in the restaurants dataset.

--  2.	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
--  List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
	-- i. 	Difference 1: The business that are still open have higher rating.
    -- ii.	Difference 2: The business that are still open have more reviews.

	-- SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT  (name), 
        (stars),
        (category),
        (review_count),
        (hours),
        (neighborhood)
        FROM 
        business b INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
        INNER JOIN hours h ON h.business_id = c.business_id
        WHERE (is_open = 1)
        GROUP BY 1
        ORDER BY 4 DESC;




-- 3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
-- Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
-- i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: (Which business do people review?)
         
         
-- ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
/*
I want to know, What people like to review more? and In which city?
*/
