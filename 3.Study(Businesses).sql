                Study: Spot a good business opportunity studying the attributes 
                and ratings of the actual businesses. 

                The idea is that when there is a good average of reviews the probability 
                of have a good amount of clients increase and a good rating for a business 
                could mean that is a service needed.
         
      Iâ€™m gonna need a dataset with the business attributes, average of stars ratings and 
      count of businesses for each attribute.
